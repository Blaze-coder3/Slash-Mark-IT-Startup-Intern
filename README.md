# Slash-Mark-IT-Startup-Intern
Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains all the projects and tasks I have worked on during my Machine Learning Internship. ðŸ“š Each project reflects my journey in applying various machine learning techniques and concepts to solve real-world problems.ðŸŒŸHere's a brief overview of what you can expect to find:

##Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing and Analysis

Tools Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Description: Explored and cleaned diverse datasets, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized key insights to better understand the data and prepare it for modeling.
Supervised Learning Models

Tools Used: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Description: Implemented and fine-tuned various supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks for classification and regression tasks.
Unsupervised Learning Models

Tools Used: Scikit-learn, SciPy
Description: Applied unsupervised learning techniques including K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to uncover hidden patterns and reduce dimensionality in datasets.
Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Tools Used: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformer-based models
Description: Developed models for text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) using traditional and advanced NLP techniques.
Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Tools Used: TensorFlow, Keras
Description: Built deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction.
Deployment and Production

Tools Used: Flask, Docker, Heroku
Description: Deployed machine learning models as RESTful APIs and web applications to make them accessible and usable for end-users.
