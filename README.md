# Slash-Mark-IT-Startup-Intern
Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains all the projects and tasks I have worked on during my Machine Learning Internship. ðŸ“š Each project reflects my journey in applying various machine learning techniques and concepts to solve real-world problems.ðŸŒŸHere's a brief overview of what you can expect to find:

# Project Highlights

# 1. Data Preprocessing and Analysis
Tools Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Description: Explored and cleaned diverse datasets, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized key insights to better understand the data and prepare it for modeling.

# 2. Supervised Learning Models
Tools Used: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
Description: Implemented and fine-tuned various supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks for classification and regression tasks.

# 3. Unsupervised Learning Models
Tools Used: Scikit-learn, SciPy
Description: Applied unsupervised learning techniques including K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal 
component analysis (PCA) to uncover hidden patterns and reduce dimensionality in datasets.

# 4.Deployment and Production
Tools Used: Flask, Docker, Heroku
Description: Deployed machine learning models as RESTful APIs and web applications to make them accessible and usable for end-users.

# Repository Structure
Data: Contains sample datasets used for various projects.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with detailed code and explanations for each project.
Scripts: Standalone Python scripts for key functionalities.
Models: Saved machine learning models for easy reuse and testing.
Docs: Documentation and reports for each project, providing insights into methodologies and results.
